pamqp.exceptions
==============
The :py:mod:`pamqp.exceptions` module is auto-generated, created by the ``tools/codegen.py`` application.

:py:mod:`pamqp.exceptions` implements AMQP exceptions as Python exceptions so that client libraries can raise these exceptions as is appropriate without having to implement their own extensions for AMQP protocol related issues.
